I do not dislike the idea of having a 3D background, if it looks realistic. It might give us some scope to move around it a bit more. 

We need some type of script/timeline?

for example, the way I imagine it is:

1. Video introduction.
title of game
game starts: player is on a street, bombs are falling. Objective: avoiding bombs but player has to retrieve some items to be able to travel:
1. passport
2. jewels/money
3. baby??

level 2, 
in the sea.
Video introduction
player has to give his money/jewels in exchange for a life vest. 
Next he is inside a boat which is rocking from side to side. 
Obstacles: 
Storm
coastguard boats trying to sink players vessel. 

level 3, 
in the border
Video introduction
player has to cross a fence where there is holes but there is dogs/guards with batons on the other side.
